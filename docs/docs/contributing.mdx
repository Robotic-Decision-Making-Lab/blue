Thank you for considering contributing to Blue! Here we provide a set of
guidelines for contributing to the project.

Contributions include but are not restricted to:

* Contributing to the Blue codebase
* Writing documentation
* Reporting bugs
* Answering [discussion questions](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/blue/discussions)

## Workflow

* Send all pull requests to the `main` branch (unless otherwise requested).
* Limit each pull request to resolving a single issue
* It is your responsibility to ensure that your development branch is
  up-to-date with the main branch. You may either rebase on main or merge main
  into your development branch.
* Always test and document your code.
* Ensure that your changes pass our CI! If you encounter issues with this,
  please ask for help.

## Support

If you have questions regarding your contribution, please create a new
discussion post on the [Discussions](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/blue/discussions)
board.
