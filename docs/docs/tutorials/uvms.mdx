### Tutorial steps

1. Launch the demo Dependencies in simulation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos uvms_demo.launch.yaml
   ```

2. Once Gazebo, ArduSub, and MAVROS have fully loaded, open a new terminal and
   launch the demo control framework:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos uvms_controllers.launch.py
   ```

3. Open a new terminal and launch the `teleop_twist_keyboard` node:

   ```bash
   ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
   ```

4. The `teleop_twist_keyboard` node will publish velocity commands according to
   [REP-105](https://ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html); however, the launched AITSMC
   adheres to the maritime conventions recorded in [REP-156](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/398).
   To convert the velocity commands to the appropriate convention, run the
   `message_transforms` node in a new terminal:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch message_transforms message_transforms.launch.py parameters_file:=<path/to/transforms.yaml>
   ```

   where `<path/to/transforms.yaml>` should be replaced with the path to the
   `transforms.yaml` file in the `blue_demos` package, e.g.,

   ```bash
   ros2 launch message_transforms message_transforms.launch.py parameters_file:=./blue_demos/teleoperation/config/transforms.yaml
   ```

5. You should now be able to teleoperate the BlueROV2 using your keyboard.
