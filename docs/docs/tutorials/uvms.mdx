This tutorial demonstrates how to use [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
to control an underwater vehicle manipulator system (i.e., the BlueROV2 Heavy
with a Reach Alpha 5) in simulation. The files used for this tutorial are available
in the `blue_demos/manipulator_systems` directory.

## Dependencies

The following ROS 2 dependencies are required for this tutorial:

* Gazebo Harmonic or newer
* [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
* [reach](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/reach)

These dependencies will be met by default if you have installed Blue with
Docker as described in the [installation instructions](/installation).

### Tutorial steps

1. Launch the demo Dependencies in simulation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos uvms_demo.launch.yaml
   ```

2. Once Gazebo and the controllers have fully loaded, you should see the UVMS
   Gazebo with a red spherical object that represents the target end effector
   pose. You can translate and rotate the object to change the target end effector pose.
