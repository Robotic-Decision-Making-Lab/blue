This tutorial demonstrates how to use [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
to control underwater vehicle manipulator systems (UVMS). The tutorial will use the BlueROV2 Heavy
with an affixed Reach Alpha 5 manipulator. The files used for this tutorial are available in the
`blue_demos/manipulator_systems` directory.

This tutorial includes two demonstrations. In the first demonstration, we show how to use implement
reactive whole-body control using closed-loop task priority inverse kinematics control. The second
demonstration extends the first by showing how to perform end effector trajectory tracking.

## Dependencies

The following ROS 2 dependencies are required for this tutorial:

* Gazebo Harmonic or newer
* [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
* [reach](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/reach)

These dependencies will be met by default if you have installed Blue with
Docker as described in the [installation instructions](/installation).

### Interactive whole-body control

The first demonstration leverages the auv_controllers `ik_controller` with the
`task_priority_solver`. The controller has been configured to dynamically track a target
that has been placed in the world. The target can be translated or rotated to change the
end effector pose.

#### Tutorial steps

1. Launch the demo in simulation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos interactive_uvms_demo.launch.yaml
   ```

2. Once Gazebo and the controllers have fully loaded, you should see the UVMS
   Gazebo with a red spherical object that represents the target end effector
   pose. You can translate and rotate the object to change the target end effector pose.

### End effector trajectory tracking

The second demonstration extends the [Interactive whole-body control](#interactive-whole-body-control)
demonstration by integrating the auv_controllers `end_effector_trajectory_controller`.
This controller is used to interpolate end effector motion plans using linear
and spherical linear interpolation. Similar to the ros2_controllers `joint_trajectory_controller`,
the `end_effector_trajectory_controller` supports sending trajectory messages using
the topic interface or the action interface. For this demonstration, we will use the
topic interface.

#### Tutorial steps

1. Launch the demo by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos trajectory_controller_demo.launch.yaml
   ```

2. Once Gazebo and the controllers have fully loaded, you can send a reference trajectory
   to the controller by running the following command in a new terminal:

   ```bash
   ros2 topic pub /end_effector_trajectory_controller/trajectory auv_control_msgs/msg/EndEffectorTrajectory '{<insert trajectory here>}'
   ```

   A pre-configured trajectory is available, and can be sent to the controller by running

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos publish_trajectory.launch.yaml
   ```
