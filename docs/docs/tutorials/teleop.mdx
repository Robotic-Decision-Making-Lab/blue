This page provides a collection of tutorials that describe how to teleoperate
a simulated or real vehicle. Prior to starting these tutorials, you should have
completed the [Running Blue in Simulation](/tutorials/simulation) tutorial and
the [Integrating Custom Controllers](/tutorials/control) tutorial.

## Keyboard teleoperation

This tutorial describes how to teleoperate a simulated BlueROV2 using your
keyboard.

### Dependencies

The following ROS 2 dependencies are required for this tutorial:

* Gazebo Harmonic or newer
* [ardusub_driver](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/ardusub_driver)
* [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
* [teleop_twist_keyboard](https://github.com/ros2/teleop_twist_keyboard)
* [mobile_to_maritime](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/mobile_to_maritime)

These dependencies will be met by default if you have installed Blue with
Docker as described in the [installation instructions](/installation).

### Tutorial steps

1. Launch the demo Dependencies in simulation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos bluerov2_demo.launch.yaml use_sim:=true
   ```

2. Once Gazebo, ArduSub, and MAVROS have fully loaded, open a new terminal and
   launch the demo control framework:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos bluerov2_controllers.launch.py use_sim:=true
   ```

3. Open a new terminal and launch the `teleop_twist_keyboard` node:

   ```bash
   ros2 run teleop_twist_keyboard teleop_twist_keyboard
   ```

4. The `teleop_twist_keyboard` node will publish velocity commands according to
   [REP-105](https://ros.org/reps/rep-0105.html); however, the launched ISMC
   adheres to the maritime conventions recorded in [REP-156](https://github.com/ros-infrastructure/rep/pull/398).
   To convert the velocity commands to the appropriate convention, run the
   `message_transforms` node in a new terminal:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch message_transforms message_transforms.launch.py parameters_file:=<path/to/transforms.yaml>
   ```

   where `<path/to/transforms.yaml>` should be replaced with the path to the
   `transforms.yaml` file in the `blue_demos` package, e.g.,

   ```bash
   ros2 launch message_transforms message_transforms.launch.py parameters_file:=./blue_demos/teleoperation/config/transforms.yaml
   ```

5. You should now be able to teleoperate the BlueROV2 using your keyboard.


## Gamepad teleoperation

This tutorial describes how to teleoperate a simulated BlueROV2 using a gamepad.

### Dependencies

The following ROS 2 dependencies are needed for this tutorial:

* Gazebo Harmonic or newer
* [ardusub_driver](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/ardusub_driver)
* [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
* [mobile_to_maritime](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/mobile_to_maritime)
* [joy_teleop](https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_tools)
* [joy_linux](https://github.com/ros-drivers/joystick_drivers/tree/ros2)

These dependencies will be met by default if you have installed Blue with
Docker as described in the [installation instructions](/installation).

In addition to the aforementioned requirements, you should also install the
`joystick` apt package, which provides Linux drivers for gamepads:

```bash
sudo apt-get install joystick
```

Verify your installation with [jstest](https://www.mankier.com/1/jstest-gtk) by
running the following command:

```bash
jstest /dev/input/<device>
```

where `<device>` should be replaced with the device name of your gamepad (e.g.,
`js0`).

:::note

For those using the Docker installation, the `joystick` package should be
installed on your local machine **outside** of the container.

:::

### Tutorial steps

1. Launch the demo BlueROV2 in simulation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos bluerov2_demo.launch.yaml use_sim:=true
   ```

2. Once Gazebo, ArduSub, and MAVROS have fully loaded, open a new terminal and
   launch the demo control framework:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos bluerov2_controllers.launch.py use_sim:=true
   ```

3. Open a new terminal and launch the ROS 2 joystick driver using the provided
   demo launch file:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos joy_teleop.launch.yaml
   ```

4. You should now be able to teleoperate the BlueROV2 using your gamepad. If
   the system is not responding, ensure that the
   [teleoperation demo configuration](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/blue/blob/31-user-docs/blue_demos/teleoperation/config/joy_teleop.yaml)
   references the correct device.

:::tip

The gamepad demo uses the left trigger as a deadman switch. To enable joystick
inputs, press and release the left trigger.

## USB/IP gamepad teleoperation

This tutorial describes how to configure [USB/IP](https://usbip.sourceforge.net/)
so that you can teleoperate a remote vehicle connected to a topside computer
via tether with a gamepad connected to your topside machine. In this
configuration, we recommend using a [Logitech F310 Gamepad](https://www.logitechg.com/en-us/products/gamepads/f310-gamepad.940-000110.html).
Additional USB/IP tutorials can be found on the [RidgeRun Developer Wiki](https://developer.ridgerun.com/wiki/index.php?title=How_to_setup_and_use_USB/IP)
and in the [Linux Magazine](https://www.linux-magazine.com/Issues/2018/208/Tutorial-USB-IP).

### Dependencies

The following apt packages are needed for this tutorial:

* `linux-tools-generic`
* `hwdata`
* `joystick`

which can be installed with the following command:

```bash
sudo apt-get install linux-tools-generic hwdata joystick
```

:::note

For those using the Docker installation, the aforementioned packages should be
installed on your local machine **outside** of the container.

:::

### Topside configuration steps

1. Enable the `usbip-core` and `usbip-host` kernel modules:

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe usbip-core && \
   sudo modprobe usbip-host
   ```

2. Start the USB/IP process as a daemon:

   ```bash
   sudo usbipd &
   ```
   :::tip

   USB/IP gets installed into directories that are not in your `$PATH`. Because
   of this, it creates symlinks in the `/usr/bin` directory. Sometimes you will
   get an error when using the default symlinks indicating that the installed
   `linux-tools-generic` version does not match the kernel. If this happens,
   delete the existing symlinks and replace them with new ones.

   :::

3. With your gamepad connected to your topside machine, verify that USB/IP is
   able to detect the gamepad device:

   ```bash
   usbip list -l
   ```

   You should observe your gamepad in the devices listed along with its bus ID.
   For instance, the Logitech F310 gamepad may be listed as

   ```
   - busid 3-4 (046d:c216)
     Logitech, Inc. : F310 Gamepad [DirectInput Mode] (046d:c216)
   ```

   where `3-4` is the bus ID.

4. Bind the gamepad device to the USB/IP process:

   ```bash
   sudo usbip bind -b <bus-id>
   ```

   where `<bus-id>` should be replaced with the bus ID of your gamepad.

5. Verify that the device has been bound by listing the exportable devices:

   ```
   usbip list -r 127.0.0.1
   ```

   which should show the gamepad device. For example, the Logitech F310 gamepad
   device may appear as

   ```
   Exportable USB devices
   ======================
   - 127.0.0.1
        3-4: Logitech, Inc. : F310 Gamepad [DirectInput Mode] (046d:c216)
           : /sys/devices/pci0000:00/0000:00:01.2/0000:20:00.0/0000:21:08.0/0000:2a:00.3/usb3/3-4
           : (Defined at Interface level) (00/00/00)
   ```

### Vehicle configuration steps

1. Load the `vhci-hcd` kernel module on the vehicle's computer:

   ```bash
   sudo modprobe vhci-hcd
   ```

2. Check that the device configured on the topside machine is observable on the
   vehicle:

   ```bash
   sudo usbip list -r <topside-ip-address>
   ```

   where `<topside-ip-address>` should be replaced with the IP address of the
   topside machine.

3. Attach the device to the vehicle:

   ```bash
   sudo usbip attach -r <topside-ip-address> -b <bus-id>
   ```

4. You should now be able to interact with the gamepad device as if it were
   connected directly to the vehicle. Confirm this with `jstest` using the
   following command:

   ```bash
   jstest /dev/input/<device>
   ```

   where `<device>` should be replaced with the device name of your gamepad on
   the vehicle.

### USB/IP shutdown steps

1. Identify the port at which the vehicle has establishe a connection with the
   topside machine:

   ```bash
   sudo usbip port
   ```

2. Detach the device from the vehicle:

   ```bash
   sudo usbip detach -p <port>
   ```

   where `<port>` should be replaced with the identified port number used for
   the connection.

3. Unbind the device from the USB/IP process:

   ```bash
   sudo usbip unbind -b <bus-id>
   ```
