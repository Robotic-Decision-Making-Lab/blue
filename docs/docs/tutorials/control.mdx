title: Integrating Custom Controllers
---

Blue integrates [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
for vehicle control. This offers the benefit of supporting the development of
custom control algorithms and enabling benchmarking against existing
controllers. The following tutorial describes how to use custom controllers
with Blue. The files used for this tutorial are available in the
`blue_demos/control_integration` directory. Prior to starting this tutorial,
you should have completed the [Running Blue in Simulation](/tutorials/simulation)
tutorial.

## Dependencies

The following ROS 2 dependencies are required for this tutorial:

* Gazebo Garden or newer
* [ardusub_driver](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/ardusub_driver)
  (for use with the BlueROV2 vehicle models)
* [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)

These dependencies will be met by default if you have installed Blue with
Docker as described in the [installation instructions](/installation).

## Tutorial steps

1. Launch the demo BlueROV2 in simulation by running the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos bluerov2_demo.launch.yaml use_sim:=true
   ```

2. Wait for Gazebo, ArduSub, and MAVROS to fully load. Typically, the `param`
   MAVROS plugin is the last to fully load, which is indicated by the following
   message:

   ```bash
   [mavros.param]: PR: parameters list received
   ```

3. Open a new terminal and launch the demo control framework:

   ```bash
   ros2 launch blue_demos bluerov2_controllers.launch.py use_sim:=true
   ```

   This should launch a set of cascading controllers, concluding with the
   `integral_sliding_mode_controller` (ISMC) controller. The control framework
   uses the `thruster_hardware/ThrusterHardware` system interface to enable
   thruster-level control with ArduSub.

   :::tip

   On occasion, the ros2_control controller manager will fail to load all of
   the controllers. If this happens, stop the launch and try again.

   :::

4. Verify that the controllers are running with the following command:

   ```bash
   ros2 control list_controllers
   ```

   The output should resemble:

   ```
   integral_sliding_mode_controller[velocity_controllers/IntegralSlidingModeController] active
   thruster_allocation_matrix_controller[thruster_allocation_matrix_controller/ThrusterAllocationMatrixController] active
   thruster_1_controller[thruster_controllers/PolynomialThrustCurveController] active
   thruster_2_controller[thruster_controllers/PolynomialThrustCurveController] active
   thruster_3_controller[thruster_controllers/PolynomialThrustCurveController] active
   thruster_4_controller[thruster_controllers/PolynomialThrustCurveController] active
   thruster_5_controller[thruster_controllers/PolynomialThrustCurveController] active
   thruster_6_controller[thruster_controllers/PolynomialThrustCurveController] active
   ```

   :::tip

   Many of the controllers implemented in `auv_controllers` support dynamically
   modifying controller parameters and gains. We encourage you to take
   advantage of this feature to tune the controllers to your specific vehicle.
   This helps avoid the need to recompile and relauch the system for each
   change that you make.
