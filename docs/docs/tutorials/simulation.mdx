title: Running Blue in Simulation
---

This tutorial describes how to launch an implemented vehicle in Gazebo with
the Gazebo hydrodynamics plugins. Our tests have found that Gazebo provides
a good representation of underwater vehicle dynamics. Alternative, *untested*
underwater simulation options that can be used with ROS 2 include:

* [Stonefish](https://stonefish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
* [HoloOcean](https://holoocean.readthedocs.io/en/master/)

We recommend exploring each simulation option to determine what best fits your
project's needs.

## Dependencies

This tutorial has the following dependencies:

* Gazebo Harmonic or newer
* [ardusub_driver](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/ardusub_driver)
  (for use with the BlueROV2 vehicle models)

These dependencies will be met by default if you have installed Blue with
Docker as described in the [installation instructions](/installation).

## Tutorial steps

To launch a [supported vehicle](/overview#supported-vehicles) in Gazebo, run
the following command:

```bash
ros2 launch blue_bringup <model-name>.launch.yaml use_sim:=true
```

where `<model-name>` should be replaced with the name of the desired vehicle.
For instance, to launch Gazebo using the BlueROV2, run

```bash
ros2 launch blue_bringup bluerov2.launch.yaml use_sim:=true
```

This should bringup Gazebo, [ArduSub](https://github.com/ArduPilot/ardupilot),
and [MAVROS](https://github.com/mavlink/mavros/tree/ros2). To test that the
BlueROV2 has been launched correctly, try changing the ArduSub flight mode by
running the following command in a new terminal:

```bash
ros2 service call /mavros/set_mode mavros_msgs/srv/SetMode "{base_mode: 0, custom_mode: 'STABILIZE'}"
```

which, if successful, should change the flight mode to `STABILIZE`.
