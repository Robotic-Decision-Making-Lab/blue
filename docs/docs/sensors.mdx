This page provides documents supported ROS drivers for sensors that are commonly used in underwater
robotics research. The [first-party sensors](#first-party-sensors) can be integrated with ROS 2
packages such as [robot_localization](https://github.com/cra-ros-pkg/robot_localization) for localization.

## First-Party Sensors

Below is a list of sensor drivers developed by our lab that are supported by Blue.

| Sensor                                                                | Driver                                                                                              | Supported ROS Versions |

## Third-Party Sensors

Below is a list of underwater sensor drivers that have been developed by the community. This list is
not exhaustive and not all drivers have been tested with Blue; however, we encourage you to try them out
and provide feedback to the authors.
