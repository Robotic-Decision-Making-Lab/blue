# Supported Sensors

This page provides documents ROS drivers for sensors that are commonly used in underwater
robotics research.

## First-Party Sensors

Below is a list of sensor drivers developed by our lab that are supported by Blue.

## Third-Party Sensors

Below is a list of underwater sensor drivers that have been developed by the community. This list is
not exhaustive and not all drivers have been tested with Blue; however, we encourage you to try them out
and provide feedback to the authors. If you have developed a driver for an underwater sensor and would like
to have it listed here, please [submit a pull request](/contributing).
