# Blue :ocean:

Blue is an ROS 2 pipeline designed to support development, testing, and
deployment of underwater vehicles. To get started with Blue, please refer to
the project [documentation](https://robotic-decision-making-lab.github.io/blue/).

## Main Features

The main features of Blue include:

- Support for custom controllers implemented using [auv_controllers](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/auv_controllers)
  and localization algorithms implemented using [marine_localization](https://github.com/Robotic-Decision-Making-Lab/marine_localization)
- Vehicle models and configurations for simulation using Gazebo
- CI/CD pipelines to help you deploy your software in the same environment
  that you performed development and testing in
- A development environment that includes many of the tools that you need to
  develop software for underwater vehicles
